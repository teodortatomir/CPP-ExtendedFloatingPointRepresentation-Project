# Extended Floating Point Representation without losing precision

This project addresses the precision limits of IEEE 754 by implementing a custom 128 bit format and a 1024 bit format!

Implemented using division on arrays, it can support numbers between [-10^310, 10^310]!

It supports numbers with period digits like : -123.4(56)

Used C++ Standard Library.

You need a C++ compiler to execute it!
